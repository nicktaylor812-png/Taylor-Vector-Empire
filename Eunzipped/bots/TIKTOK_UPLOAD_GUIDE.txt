        TIKTOK UPLOAD GUIDE - TAYLOR VECTOR TERMINAL
         NBA Analytics Content | 60-Second Tutorial Videos
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

📋 OVERVIEW
-----------
This guide provides best practices for manually uploading NBA analytics 
tutorial videos to TikTok. Since TikTok API integration requires separate 
OAuth approval, this focuses on the manual upload process to maximize reach 
and engagement.


🎬 PRE-UPLOAD CHECKLIST
-----------------------
Before uploading your video, ensure you have:

✅ Video file (MP4, MOV, or WEBM format)
   - Resolution: 1080x1920 (9:16 vertical format)
   - Duration: 15-60 seconds (aim for 55-60s for full content)
   - Frame rate: 23.98-60 fps
   - File size: Under 287.6 MB

✅ Script ready (from bots/tiktok_scripts/)
   - Review all timing indicators
   - Verify visual cue markers are followed
   - Check hook/body/CTA structure is clear

✅ Text overlays prepared
   - Key stats and formulas visible
   - On-screen graphics ready for critical moments
   - Ensure text is readable on mobile screens

✅ Caption text (from script's CTA section)
   - Keep under 2,200 characters (aim for 300-500)
   - Include primary hashtags
   - Add link-in-bio call-to-action


📱 UPLOAD PROCESS (STEP-BY-STEP)
---------------------------------

STEP 1: Open TikTok App
   - Use TikTok mobile app (iOS/Android) for best results
   - Desktop uploads available but limited features

STEP 2: Click "+" Button
   - Located at bottom center of screen
   - Select "Upload" option

STEP 3: Select Your Video
   - Choose your pre-edited NBA analytics video
   - TikTok will auto-adjust to 9:16 if needed (avoid this - upload correct ratio)

STEP 4: Edit & Enhance (Optional)
   - Add trending sounds (see TRENDING SOUNDS section)
   - Apply filters (subtle recommended for analytics content)
   - Adjust clip timing if needed
   - Add TikTok's native text/stickers sparingly

STEP 5: Add Caption
   Format:
   [Hook/teaser line from script]
   
   [Key insight in 1-2 sentences]
   
   Link in bio for full leaderboard/calculator/predictions
   
   [Hashtags - see HASHTAG STRATEGY section]

   Example:
   "MJ vs LeBron: The metrics finally settle it 🐐
   
   MJ had higher usage (40.13 TUSG%) while LeBron dominated with efficiency 
   (39.21 PVR). Both are top 15 all-time in their respective metrics.
   
   Link in bio for full cross-era rankings 📊
   
   #NBA #MichaelJordan #LeBronJames #GOAT #GOATDebate #Basketball #NBAHistory"

STEP 6: Select Cover Image
   - Choose a frame showing a key stat or graphic
   - Ensure text is readable in thumbnail
   - Faces + stats perform best

STEP 7: Advanced Settings
   ✅ Turn on "Allow Comments" (engagement boost)
   ✅ Turn on "Allow Duet" (virality potential)
   ✅ Turn on "Allow Stitch" (reach expansion)
   ✅ Disable "Allow downloads" (protect original content)
   ⚠️  Location: Add "United States" or specific NBA city
   ⚠️  Disclosure: Mark "Branded content" if sponsored

STEP 8: Post Timing
   - Best times: 6-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 7-11 PM EST
   - Avoid game times (users watching live games)
   - Post 2-4 hours before major NBA games for max engagement
   - Weekdays > Weekends for analytics content

STEP 9: Click "Post"
   - Video goes live immediately
   - Monitor first hour for engagement signals


🎵 TRENDING SOUNDS STRATEGY
---------------------------
TikTok's algorithm heavily favors trending sounds. Choose from:

CURRENT TRENDING (Check TikTok's "Sounds" page):
   • Sports commentary/hype audio
   • Dramatic reveal/mind-blown sounds
   • Educational content beats
   • "I told you so" victory audio

EVERGREEN SOUNDS FOR ANALYTICS:
   • "original sound" (your own voiceover - best for credibility)
   • Storytelling beats (medium tempo, non-distracting)
   • Background music for explainer content
   • Upbeat sports highlight music

PRO TIP: Use trending sounds for first 5-7 videos to build audience, 
then switch to original sound for brand authority.


#️⃣ HASHTAG STRATEGY
--------------------
Use 5-10 hashtags per video. Mix broad reach + niche targeting.

TIER 1 - BROAD REACH (Always include 2-3):
   #NBA #Basketball #NBAStats #Stats #Analytics

TIER 2 - NICHE TARGETING (Include 2-3 based on content):
   #TUSG #PVR #Efficiency #Usage #NBAAnalytics #HoopsAnalytics
   #BasketballIQ #NBATikTok #DataScience

TIER 3 - TRENDING/SPECIFIC (Include 2-3 based on video topic):
   #MichaelJordan #LeBronJames #StephenCurry #Westbrook #Jokic
   #MVP #GOAT #GOATDebate #NBAHistory #TripleDouble #73Wins

TIER 4 - VIRAL/ENGAGEMENT (Optional 1-2):
   #FYP #ForYou #Viral #LearnOnTikTok #TikTokSports

AVOID:
   ❌ Banned hashtags (#gambling with money emoji, explicit betting terms)
   ❌ Too many hashtags (looks spammy, reduces credibility)
   ❌ Irrelevant trending hashtags (algorithm penalizes)


📊 CONTENT CALENDAR RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------------
Post consistently for algorithm favor. Suggested schedule:

WEEK 1-2 (Build Foundation):
   • Mon/Wed/Fri: Post 1 script from library
   • Focus on basics: TUSG%, PVR, Westbrook Rule
   • Use trending sounds for initial reach

WEEK 3-4 (Engagement Focus):
   • Mon/Wed/Fri/Sun: 4x per week
   • Add debate/comparison content: MJ vs LeBron, Usage vs Efficiency
   • Respond to ALL comments within first hour

WEEK 5+ (Authority Building):
   • Daily posting (7x per week)
   • Mix evergreen content + timely game predictions
   • Use original sound to build brand voice
   • Experiment with different hooks for same topic


💡 VISUAL CUE MARKERS (FROM SCRIPTS)
-------------------------------------
All scripts include visual cue markers like:
   [On-screen text: "TRADITIONAL USG% IS BROKEN 🚨"]
   [Show formula graphic: (FGA + TOV + FTA×0.44) / (MIN/48 × Pace) × 100]
   [Show graphic: Westbrook 48.1% > League Average 20%]
   [End screen: "BOTH GOATS 🐐🐐"]

HOW TO IMPLEMENT:
   1. Use video editing software (CapCut, InShot, Adobe Premiere)
   2. Add text overlays at specified timestamps
   3. Use bold, high-contrast fonts (white text + black outline)
   4. Keep text on screen 2-4 seconds minimum
   5. Animate text entrance/exit for engagement
   6. Use emojis strategically (1-2 per screen)


🎯 HOOK/BODY/CTA STRUCTURE
---------------------------
Every script follows proven TikTok engagement structure:

HOOK (0:00-0:15) - 15 seconds:
   • Grabs attention with bold claim or question
   • Uses pattern interrupt (challenges common belief)
   • Shows visual immediately (no talking head intro)
   Example: "You've been using Usage % wrong this whole time..."

BODY (0:15-0:50) - 35 seconds:
   • EXPLANATION (0:15-0:40): Teaches concept with formula/graphic
   • EXAMPLE (0:40-0:50): Shows real NBA player stats as proof
   • Uses text overlays for key metrics
   • Fast cuts every 2-3 seconds

CTA (0:50-0:60) - 10 seconds:
   • Clear next action: "Follow for more", "Link in bio"
   • Reinforces key takeaway
   • End screen graphic with text
   • Loops naturally to hook (for rewatchability)


📈 POST-UPLOAD OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------

FIRST HOUR (CRITICAL):
   ✅ Respond to every comment
   ✅ Like every comment
   ✅ Pin best question/comment to top
   ✅ Share to Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
   ✅ Post teaser in IG Stories linking to TikTok

FIRST 24 HOURS:
   ✅ Monitor analytics (Views, Completion Rate, Shares)
   ✅ If completion rate < 40%: Hook is weak, adjust next video
   ✅ If views stall < 500: Hashtags may be wrong, try different set
   ✅ Note which topics get most comments for future content

ONGOING:
   ✅ Repost top performers after 30 days (with slight hook variation)
   ✅ Create "Part 2" for videos with 10k+ views
   ✅ Use TikTok Analytics to find best posting times
   ✅ Collaborate/duet with sports analytics creators


🚀 GROWTH HACKS
---------------

1. COMMENT ON RELATED VIDEOS
   - Find trending NBA debate videos
   - Leave insightful analytical comments
   - Include "I break this down on my page" (no link needed)
   - Algorithm shows your profile to those users

2. USE SERIES FORMAT
   - Create numbered series: "Stats the media won't tell you #1"
   - Viewers binge your content for full story
   - Pin series playlist to profile

3. LEVERAGE NBA MOMENTS
   - Post within 2 hours of major NBA events
   - "Why [player]'s performance was actually [stat insight]"
   - Ride trending hashtags from live games

4. CROSS-PROMOTE
   - Link to your website/dashboard in bio
   - Update bio weekly with timely hook
   - Use Linktree for multiple links (leaderboard, predictions, etc.)

5. COLLABORATE
   - Duet popular NBA takes with analytical response
   - Stitch viral debates with data-driven conclusion
   - Tag NBA creators in comments (respectfully)


⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID
----------------------------

❌ Talking head for first 3 seconds (instant scroll)
✅ Start with text overlay + bold claim

❌ Complex formulas without visual (confusing)
✅ Show formula graphic with simple example

❌ No captions (50%+ watch without sound)
✅ Always add TikTok auto-captions + verify accuracy

❌ Posting inconsistently (algorithm penalizes)
✅ Post minimum 3x per week, same times

❌ Ignoring comments (kills engagement rate)
✅ Respond within first hour for algorithm boost

❌ Using copyrighted NBA footage (takedown risk)
✅ Use graphics, text, and stats instead

❌ Too long (attention span is 8 seconds)
✅ Hook must grab in first 3 seconds

❌ Selling/promoting immediately (low trust)
✅ Provide value first, subtle CTA to bio


📊 SUCCESS METRICS
------------------
Track these to measure content performance:

PRIMARY METRICS:
   • Video Views: Aim for 1k+ in first 24 hours
   • Completion Rate: Target 50%+ (60%+ is excellent)
   • Engagement Rate: (Likes + Comments + Shares) / Views > 8%
   • Profile Visits: 10-15% of viewers should visit profile

GROWTH METRICS:
   • Follower Growth: Expect 1-5% follower conversion from views
   • Link Clicks: Track bio link clicks (TikTok shows this in analytics)
   • Share Rate: 2%+ means content is highly valuable

BENCHMARK GOALS:
   Week 1-2: 500-1,000 views per video
   Week 3-4: 2,000-5,000 views per video
   Month 2+: 10,000+ views per video
   Month 3+: 1 viral video (100k+ views) per month


🔗 LINK IN BIO STRATEGY
------------------------
Your TikTok bio link is CRITICAL for converting viewers. Best practices:

BIO TEXT (150 character limit):
   "NBA analytics that predict the future 🏀
   TUSG% + PVR = Better than Vegas
   👇 Free leaderboards, predictions & tools"

LINK OPTIONS:
   Option 1 - Direct to main dashboard
   Option 2 - Linktree with multiple destinations:
      • All-Time TUSG% Leaderboard
      • Today's Game Predictions
      • PVR Calculator
      • Westbrook Hall of Fame
      • Premium Reports (if monetizing)

UPDATE WEEKLY:
   - Change based on your latest viral video
   - If "MJ vs LeBron" video goes viral → Link to Cross-Era Rankings
   - If "Game Predictions" blows up → Link to Today's Picks
