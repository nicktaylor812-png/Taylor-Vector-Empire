      "text": "1962: Teams averaged 126 possessions per game (Wilt's era)\n2020: Teams averaged 99.5 possessions per game (Giannis' era)\n\n[Show pace comparison chart]\n\nTUSG% adjusts for this. It asks: 'If both played at the SAME pace, who dominated more?'\n\nWilt 1962: 44.73 TUSG% (50 PPG adjusted for pace)\nGiannis 2020: 43.51 TUSG% (29.5 PPG adjusted for pace)\n\nNow it's fair. Same math, different eras."

      "text": "The result? Wilt edges Giannis in usage, but it's CLOSE.\n\n[Show: #3 Wilt vs #4 Giannis all-time]\n\nWithout pace adjustment? Not even comparable. With TUSG%? Legitimate debate."
