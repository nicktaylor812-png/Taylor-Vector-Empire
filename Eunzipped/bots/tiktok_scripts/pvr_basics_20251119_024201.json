How many points you GENERATE per possession you USE.\n\n[Show formula: (PTS + AST\u00d7Mult) / (FGA + TOV + FTA\u00d70.44 + AST) - 1] \u00d7 100\n\nTS% only counts your own scoring. PVR counts assists - the points you CREATE for teammates.\n\nHigh PVR = elite efficiency. You're not just scoring, you're making everyone better."
