True Usage % = how much a player controls the offense, adjusted for team pace.\n\n[Show formula graphic: (FGA + TOV + FTA\u00d70.44) / (MIN/48 \u00d7 Pace) \u00d7 100]\n\nIt answers: 'If this player was on ANY team, how much would they dominate the ball?'\n\nNow we can compare Wilt to Harden. Modern stars to '80s legends. Fair math."
