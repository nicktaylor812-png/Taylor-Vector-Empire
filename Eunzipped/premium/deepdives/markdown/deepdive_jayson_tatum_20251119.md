## 🧮 Methodology

**TUSG% (True Usage %)**: Measures the percentage of team possessions used by a player when on the court
- Formula: (FGA + TOV + (FTA × 0.44)) / ((MP/48) × TeamPace) × 100
- Higher = More offensive responsibility

**PVR (Possession Value Rating)**: Measures the value created per possession used
- Formula: [(PTS + (AST × Multiplier)) / (FGA + TOV + (0.44 × FTA) + AST) - 1.00] × 100
- Higher = More efficient production
