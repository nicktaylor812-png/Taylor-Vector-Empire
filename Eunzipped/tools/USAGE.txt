EXAMPLE EXPERIMENTS:
--------------------
🔥 "Volume Only" Setup:
   - FGA Weight: 2.0, TOV Weight: 0.5, FTA Mult: 0.60
   - Result: Wilt, Kobe, Harden dominate

⚡ "Efficiency Premium" Setup:
   - AST Threshold: 1.5, High Mult: 3.0, Low Mult: 1.5
   - Result: Magic, Curry, Jokić rise to top

🏀 "Modern Era Bias" Setup:
